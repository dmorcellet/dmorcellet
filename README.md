I'm a professional software developer. I live near Paris, in France.

Besides my projects at work, here is the place where I put my own hobby projects.

My main project is Lotro Companion, a desktop application for those who play Lord Of The Rings Online (LOTRO).
I have been playing LOTRO since 2010, and I started the LotroCompanion project in 2011. It is now a big application and has its own GitHub "organization" now.

I have some other projects but none has been released yet. I also have tons of ideas for small applications. But it takes 5 minutes to have an idea and 5 months or 5 years to make it real.

Feel free to contact me by email, if you want.
